torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 18.67 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 47.53 GiB of which 15.19 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 32.33 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 16.05 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 15.96 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
